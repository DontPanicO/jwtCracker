==== alg can be retrieved from jwks ====
#Since JWKs provides info about the algorithm we can
#retrieve it from them when looking for the verifier key.
#We have to options: keep the user input alg for all the
#iteration, and skip keys with differents arguments or,
#change alg when the JWK use a different one.
#If we use the second option, make sure to handle exceptions
#raised when we try to verify the signature with a different
#key type
