==== compute rsa public keys ====
#Since JWTs are pairs of msg:sign, we can use this info
#to retrieve the public key and try to use it in an alg
#confusion attack. In order to this, we need a fast math
#library and methods to apply hashing and padding to
#the message. A new branch for this has been created.
#We need theese options:
#1) An option to say that the user want to compute the key
#2) An option to grab a second token
